      <h2>The Problem CLEAR™ Solves</h2>
      <p>
        Volunteer organizations are filled with talented, committed people who care deeply about their mission.
        Yet many struggle with inconsistent execution, role confusion, and burnout.
      </p>
      <p>
        Motivation is not the issue. Design is.
      </p>
      <p class="emphasis">
        CLEAR™ is designed for environments where authority is limited — but results still matter.

      <ul class="framework-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Clarity</strong> — Define outcomes, roles, and ownership before activity begins.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Leverage</strong> — Replace heroics with simple, repeatable systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Execution</strong> — Make the right behavior the default behavior.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accountability</strong> — Create visibility and feedback without micromanagement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Results</strong> — Measure what actually changed, not just what was attempted.
        </li>
